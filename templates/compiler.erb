Hi,

Thanks for starting off weeknotes. You are now set as the compiler for this round.

This means that only you can stop and collect this week's weeknotes. You can do this nat any time by writing an email to me with the subject 'End Weeknotes'. The weeknotes will then be compiled and emailed to you.

Now that you've got the ball rolling, all submissions will be copied to you and the rest of the group. Every now and again, non-submitters will be pestered for contributions. This will continue until you close the weeknotes.

Thanks for compiling this week.
