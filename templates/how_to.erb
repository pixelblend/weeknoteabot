Hi,

I don't understand why you sent this. It doesn't look like weeknotes have started yet this week. I'll let you know when they are.

Here's how weeknotes works:

To start weeknotes this week, send an email with the subject "Begin Weeknotes". This will set you as the compiler for this week. Only you will be able to compile the weeknotes that week and most importantly stop the nagging emails to those who don't submit them!
