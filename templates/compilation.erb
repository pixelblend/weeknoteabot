Here are the compiled weeknotes for this week:

<% messages.each do |msg| %>
<%= msg.sender %> said:

<%= msg.body %>

<% unless msg.attachments.empty? %>
They also attached the following files:
<%= msg.attachments.collect{|a| a[:name]}.join(', ') %>
<% end %>
----
<% end %>

All attachments are attached as a zip file.

Thanks for doing weeknotes!
