#TODO
* Weeknote that parses Mail object and returns clean output
  - Body in plain text
  - Subject
  - name of sender
  - email address
  - array of attachments
* Reply to emails by keeping their subject line
  - e.g. RE: **your subject**

##Post-MVP:
* Source contributors list from somewhere decent
* Add post-compilation period, email goes to list, sender is told off
* Reply to 'weeknotes start' emails when state is ready
* Email compiler confirming they are in charge of weeknotes
