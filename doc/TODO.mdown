#TODO
* Add 'status' email
* Email compiler confirming they are in charge of weeknotes

##Post-MVP:
* Email response classes have too much to do
* Remove annoying signatures
* Source contributors list from somewhere decent
* Add post-compilation period, email goes to list, sender is told off
* Reply to 'weeknotes start' emails when state is ready
