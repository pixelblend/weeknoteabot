#TODO
* Email response classes have too much to do
  * Parse on subject, rather than state
  * e.g. 'trigger' subjects (start / stop weeknotes, status)
  * Still guard early against non-contributors

##Post-MVP:
* Add 'status' email
* Remove annoying signatures from incoming emails
* Source contributors list from somewhere decent
* Add post-compilation period, email goes to list, sender is told off
* Reply to 'weeknotes start' emails when state is ready
