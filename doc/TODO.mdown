# TODO
* Class to defer nag emails - Run thread, sleep for period X, trigger email

##Post-MVP:
* Source contributors list from somewhere decent
* Add post-compilation period, email goes to list, sender is told off
* Reply to 'weeknotes start' emails when state is ready
* Email compiler confirming they are in charge of weeknotes
